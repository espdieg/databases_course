# databases_course
This repository contains a couple projects I worked on for my Database Systems course.

# Project 1
In this first project, the objective was to install and get familiar with using MySQL Workbench 8.0 to create tables, import data, and then formulate SQL queries to find specified data.  I have included files named 'databases_project1_instructions' and 'SQL_queries'. We also have folders named 'data' and 'Outputs'. 
- databases_project1_instructions - Contains the instructions provided. Disclaimer: I do not own these. I just removed extra information to cut down the document to the instructions necessary to complete project.
- SQL_queries - This text file contains all SQL queries I created and entered within MySQL Workbench. (questions for each query are found in the instructions document)
- data - This folder was provided to us with data for each table. Our job was to import this into MySQL Workbench.
- Outputs - This folder contains the CSV table output of each of the 9 queries I executed. 
# Project 2
In this second project, the goal was to create a single python script that would connect to our database, create tables, populate data, and execute queries. The only interaction with MySQL workbench this time was to create the main schema 'project2'. I have included the files databases_project2_instructions', 'output', and 'project2'. 
- databases_projec2_instructions - Contains the instructions provided. Disclaimer: I do not own these. I just removed extra information to cut down the document to the instructions necessary to complete project.
- output - Contains the output of my python program. I just copied and pasted from console onto a text file.
- project2 - This is my python file that creates tables, enters data, and executes queries.

To run project 2 I used 'Spyder' IDE and needed to install mysql.connector by running "pip install mysql-connector-python".
